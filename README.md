# popular-movies
Project Popular Movies for submission to "Android Developer Nanodegree" course in Udacity.

The project needs an api key for The Movie Database Api (https://developers.themoviedb.org) in order to compile and run.

To specify the key, create a file named "the-movie-db-api-key" (no extension) in the app folder. In the file enter your Api key at the first line. Be sure there are no newlines in the file.
